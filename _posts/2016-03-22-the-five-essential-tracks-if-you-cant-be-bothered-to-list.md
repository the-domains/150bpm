**THE ESSENTIAL TRACKS OF HARD HOUSE**

Jump on YouTube and please have a listen to these tracks: 

**"Looking Good" by Lisa Lashes (Tidy Trax / 1999)**

Looking Good by Lisa Lashes is one of my favourite all-time records, whatever the genre. As a hard house track, it's difficult to compete with its power and subtlety. The use of the spoken word NASA moon landing vocal is sparse and the hoover stabs, whilst numerous, remain monotone and moody as fuck. The best bit though is when the main off-beat bassline comes in after the first use of the vocal sample near the beginning. 

**"Are You All Ready?" by Tony De Vit (Jump Wax Records / 1996) **

How many times have I banged on about Tony De Vit in this article? Eleven times so far. Everyone says that "The Dawn" is his best track but I've always preferred "Are You All Ready?" The Dawn is a trance tune and this one is bare bones, horrible, horrible hard house with overbearing closed 909 hi-hats that don't stop to breathe, a bossy open 909 hi-hat that does let itself breathe, one of those domineering off-beat basslines that is standard for the genre and the most hooversome of hoover lines that ever got hoovered up and recorded. 

**"Bits and Pieces" by Artemesia (Flying International / 1994) **

I've tried to replicated the kick drum pattern from this track on many of my, as yet, unreleased tracks. All would all benefit from the complicated and unpredictable kick drum pattern from To The Beat, but I've found it too complicated to do in my version of Ableton 9\. You can tell that this was written by a Dutch bloke in the mid-90s just by the melody. I don't know how, but when you listen to it, you'll know what I mean. The original mix of "Bits and Pieces" is one of the most mind-bendingly euphoric hard house songs of all time.

**"Hoovers and Horns (Ingo Remix)" by Fergie and BK (Nukleuz / 2000) **

Tony De Vit had sadly passed on by 2000 and things were about to get inane, but before they did, Ingo (previously known by the better moniker, Ingo Starr) delivered this remix of Fergie and BK's stomping duet with the funny sounding vocal, and every working hard house DJ from Birmingham to Leeds, from Sheffield to Rochdale and back to Leeds and Birmingham again were slotting this into every set during the entire night. I once heard it played seven times in a row by Paul Glazby at The Sanctuary.

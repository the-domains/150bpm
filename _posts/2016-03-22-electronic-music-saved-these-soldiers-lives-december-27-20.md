THUMP: Can you briefly explain how you got injured? Tim: On October 15, I took over for an injured marine on a routine morning patrol. While we were moving back to our base, my squad leader spotted the enemy and told us to form a defensive perimeter. As I walked into an irrigation ditch, I stepped directly on a 15-pound homemade explosive with five pounds of shrapnel—everything from bike chains and sprockets to gears. It wasn’t until I opened my eyes that I realized I was almost fully blind and my hand was hanging off my arm. Once the corpsman ran over to apply first aid, the pain set in.  Patrick: I was a minesweeper during my tour in Afghanistan. Due to the large number of IEDs, we were forced to patrol in a single file line. The man in front would attempt to mitigate the IED risk for the rest of the patrol by utilizing a special metal detector. I was that man. On my final patrol before going home, I stepped on a pressure plate, which is a crude, yet effective, homemade land mine.  Tim in recovery.  Did you guys always love electronic music, or was that something that developed after your time abroad? Tim:\_I was lucky enough to bring a iPod on my Afghanistan deployment and listened to Five Finger Death Punch to get me ready for patrols.

I went on YouTube and found a song my good buddy played for me in Afghanistan--“Almost Familiar” by Pretty Lights. It instantly brought me back and the rest is history.  Patrick: Before my injury, I knew about electronic music but had never really experienced it.

**Electronic Music Saved These Soldiers' Lives**

_December 27, 2013 David Garber_

Last month, I was at the Electric Forest festival in Michigan when I noticed two guys with glowstick-covered prosthetic legs raving in the crowd. I knew I had to hear their story. It turns out Pat and Tim had both lost their limbs while serving in the war in Afghanistan. It wasn't the only life-altering occurance they shared; ever since the accident, they've become huge fans of electronic music, and dance festivals have become their personal forms of therapy.  Tim, 24, was born in Utah but grew up in Starkville, Mississippi. After graduating from high school (around the time I was deciding which snap-back to wear to tenth grade), he attended boot camp and eventually was shipped to the Persian Gulf and then to Marjah, Afghanistan, where an IED (Improvised Explosive Device) blast would tragically take his left leg. After twenty surgeries that worked to keep his left hand and stabilize his amputation, Tim was then sent to Balboa Naval Medical center in San Diego for extended recovery.  Patrick, 26, grew up in a small town called Tivoli in upstate New York to hippie parents and a well-educated liberal family. He was sent to Sangin, Afghanistan with the 1st Battalion 5th Marine Division, and made it all the way to the final day of his deployment when a land mine took out his leg. Like Tim, he was sent to San Diego for treatment.  One night, Tim was blasting some dirty dubstep in the recovery barracks when Pat walked in to join the party. They quickly realized they shared more than just a tragic injury. Having experienced multiple festivals myself and knowing first hand how rave culture often fosters a sense of belonging and community, I decided to have an in-depth conversation with the guys about how DJs and electronic music---literally---saved their lives.
